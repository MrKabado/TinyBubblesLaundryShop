            <p>The laundry shop was originally owned by another person. When it first started, it experienced a slow progress. However, just as the business starts to grow and gain more customer that can no longer be managed, the owner decided to sell it because he can no longer managed both of his stores at the same time. Seeing the potential of it, Marry Anne M. Canete decided to purchase it and continue its operations. With the help of her stepson, John Gave, she successfully maintained it and improved the business, which is now running smoothly.</p>
